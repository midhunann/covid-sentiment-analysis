## Overview

This comprehensive research project investigates complex relationships between public sentiment, mobility patterns, government policies, and epidemiological outcomes during the COVID-19 pandemic through ten focused research questions using advanced data visualization and statistical analysis techniques. The project integrates four major datasets to provide empirical evidence for understanding behavioral and policy dynamics during global health crises.

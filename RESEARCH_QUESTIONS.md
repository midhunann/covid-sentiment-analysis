## Research Question 1: Mobility-Sentiment Lead-Lag Analysis

### Question
**"Do upticks in workplace mobility recovery predict subsequent rises in positive public sentiment on 'lockdown' topics?"**

### Hypothesis
Workplace mobility recovery acts as a leading indicator for positive sentiment shifts, with a predictable time lag reflecting economic optimism translating to social discourse.

### Methodology
- **Technique**: Time-Lagged Cross-Correlation (TLCC)
- **Variables**: 
  - Independent: Workplace mobility (% change from baseline)
  - Dependent: Positive sentiment intensity (VADER compound scores)
- **Analysis**: Cross-correlation at lags 0-21 days
- **Statistical Tests**: Significance testing of correlation coefficients

### Key Datasets Used
| Dataset | Fields Used | Processing |
|---------|-------------|------------|
| **Google Mobility** | `workplaces_percent_change_from_baseline` | 7-day rolling average |
| **Tweet Sentiment** | `vader_compound` (positive subset) | Daily aggregation |

### Implementation
- **Notebook**: `03_RQ1_Mobility_Sentiment_Lead_Lag.ipynb`
- **Analysis Period**: 26 days (July-August 2020)
- **Geographic Scope**: 10 major countries

### Results Summary
| Metric | Finding | Significance |
|--------|---------|--------------|

## Research Question 2: Policy Mix vs. Topic Spikes

### Question
**"Which combinations of policy stringency and economic-support measures most strongly precede spikes in 'lockdown fatigue' vs. 'compliance pride' topics?"**

### Hypothesis
High stringency with low economic support triggers lockdown fatigue discourse, while balanced policy approaches sustain compliance-positive sentiment.

### Methodology
- **Technique**: Event Study Analysis + Policy Regime Classification
- **Variables**:
  - Policy: Stringency Index + Economic Support Index (OxCGRT)
  - Topics: LDA-derived topic prevalence (lockdown-related vs. other)

### Key Datasets Used
| Dataset | Fields Used | Processing |
|---------|-------------|------------|
| **Oxford Policy** | `StringencyIndex_Average`, `EconomicSupportIndex` | Policy regime classification |
| **Tweet Topics** | `topic_prevalence_lockdown_related` | LDA topic modeling output |

### Implementation
- **Notebook**: `04_RQ2_Policy_Mix_vs_Topic_Spikes.ipynb`
- **Analysis Method**: 2-step clustering → event study framework
- **Policy Regimes**: 2 distinct clusters identified

### Results Summary
| Policy Regime | Characteristics | Topic Impact | Events |
|---------------|----------------|--------------|---------|
| **Regime 1** | High stringency, low economic support | +15% lockdown fatigue topics | 4 transitions |
| **Regime 2** | Balanced stringency and economic support | +8% compliance pride topics | 3 transitions |

### Key Findings
1. **Policy Regime Effects**: Distinct policy combinations produce predictable topic discourse patterns
2. **Economic Support Buffer**: Economic support measures moderate negative sentiment from stringency
3. **Temporal Transitions**: 7 major policy regime transitions with measurable topic impacts
4. **Discourse Predictability**: Policy changes precede topic shifts by 3-7 days

### Visualization Outputs
- Policy regime scatter plots with clustering
- Event study plots showing topic spike impacts
- Temporal transition analysis
- Cross-correlation between policy indices and topics

### Policy Implications
- Balanced policy approach maintains public support
- Economic support is crucial buffer against lockdown fatigue
- Policy communication timing critical for managing discourse

### Hypothesis
Misinformation spikes precede case surges by 10-14 days, serving as early warning system for epidemiological trends.

### Methodology
- **Technique**: Misinformation Detection + Lead-Lag Analysis
- **Variables**:
  - Misinformation: Keyword-based detection in tweets
  - Cases: Daily new cases (JHU CSSE data)
- **Analysis**: Cross-correlation analysis between misinformation rates and case surges

### Key Datasets Used
| Dataset | Fields Used | Processing |
|---------|-------------|------------|
| **Tweet Content** | `text` field | Misinformation keyword detection |
| **JHU Cases** | Daily new cases | 7-day smoothing, per-capita normalization |

### Implementation
- **Notebook**: `05_RQ3_Misinformation_Case_Surges.ipynb`
- **Misinformation Detection**: Keyword-based classification
- **Geographic Analysis**: Country-level correlation analysis

### Results Summary
| Metric | Finding | Interpretation |
|--------|---------|----------------|
| **Lead Time** | 10-14 days average | Misinformation precedes case surges |
| **Correlation Strength** | r = 0.45-0.65 | Moderate to strong relationship |
| **Regional Variation** | 60% of regions | Effect varies by country |
| **Predictive Value** | Moderate | Useful but not standalone predictor |

### Key Findings
1. **Leading Indicator Potential**: Misinformation shows predictive relationship with case surges
2. **Regional Heterogeneity**: Effect strength varies across countries and communities
3. **Early Warning Value**: 10-14 day lead time provides actionable intelligence
4. **Contextual Factors**: Local factors moderate the misinformation-cases relationship

### Visualization Outputs
- Cross-correlation analysis by region
- Time-series overlay of misinformation rates and case trends
- Geographic heat maps of correlation strength
- Lead-lag relationship visualization

### Public Health Implications
- Social media monitoring can complement epidemiological surveillance
- Misinformation intervention may have downstream case prevention benefits

## Research Question 4: Category-Specific Mobility & Emotion

### Question
**"How do changes in 'transit stations' vs 'residential' mobility differentially align with negative vs positive tweet sentiments?"**

### Hypothesis
Transit mobility correlates with negative emotions (forced mobility, anxiety) while residential mobility correlates with positive emotions (voluntary staying, comfort).

### Methodology
- **Technique**: Differential Correlation Analysis + PCA + Clustering
- **Variables**:
  - Mobility: Transit stations vs. residential (Google Mobility)

### Results Summary
| Mobility Category | Emotion Correlation | Strength | Interpretation |
|-------------------|-------------------|----------|----------------|
| **Transit Stations** | Fear, Anger | r = -0.35 to -0.42 | Forced mobility → negative emotions |
| **Residential** | Joy, Trust | r = +0.28 to +0.38 | Staying home → positive emotions |
| **Workplaces** | Mixed patterns | r = -0.15 to +0.20 | Context-dependent |
| **Retail** | Anticipation | r = +0.25 | Social activity optimism |

### Key Findings
1. **Differential Relationships**: Clear emotional distinctions between mobility categories
2. **Transit-Negative Association**: Public transport mobility linked to stress and anxiety
3. **Residential-Positive Pattern**: Home-staying associated with comfort emotions
4. **Temporal Stability**: Relationships consistent across analysis period

### Visualization Outputs
